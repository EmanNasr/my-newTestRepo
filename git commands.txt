Create a local git repository

cd "C:\myRepo\"

mkdir "my-project"

initialize a git repository in the root of the folder

git init

Go ahead and add a new file to the project, using any text editor

you can run git status command to see which files git knows exist.
git status





To add a file to a commit, you first need to add it to the staging environment. To do this, you can use the git add <filename> command (see Step 3 below).

git add arra.cpp


Once you've used the git add command to add all the files you want to the staging environment, you can then tell git to package them into a commit using the git commit command. 


If you rerun the git status command, you'll see that git has added the file to the staging

git status

git commit -m "This is my first commit!"


switch branches command if u need: git checkout branchname
